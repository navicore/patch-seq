//! Include Resolver for Seq
//!
//! Resolves include statements, loads and parses included files,
//! and merges everything into a single Program.
//!
//! Supports:
//! - `include std:name` - loads from embedded stdlib (or filesystem fallback)
//! - `include ffi:name` - loads FFI manifest (collected but not processed here)
//! - `include "path"` - loads relative to current file
