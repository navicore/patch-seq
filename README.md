# Seq - Concatenative Language

A concatenative, stack-based programming language that compiles to native executables. Seq combines the elegance of stack-based programming with a sophisticated type system, guaranteed tail call optimization, and CSP-style concurrency.

**Resources:** [Documentation](https://navicore.github.io/patch-seq/) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/navicore/patch-seq)

> **Naming guide:** The GitHub repository is `patch-seq`. On [crates.io](https://crates.io), the packages are published as `seq-compiler`, `seq-repl`, and `seq-lsp`. Once installed, the binaries are `seqc`, `seqr`, and `seq-lsp`.

```seq
: factorial ( Int -- Int )
  dup 1 i.<= if
    drop 1
  else
    dup 1 i.- factorial i.*
  then
;

: main ( -- ) 10 factorial int->string io.write-line ;
```

## Project Status

Stable as of 4.0. The language and standard library are stable and used by the creators for their own projects. That said, Seq is a niche experimental language - adopt it with eyes open. Future versions follow strict semantic versioning: major version increments indicate breaking changes to the language or standard library. Minor and patch versions add features and fixes without breaking existing code.

---

## Why Seq?

*Stack-based simplicity.* No variable declarations, no argument lists - values flow through the stack. Code reads left-to-right as a pipeline of transformations.

*Strongly typed with effect tracking.* Stack effects aren't just comments - they're enforced by the compiler. The type system tracks not only what goes on and off the stack, but also side effects like yielding from generators:

```seq
: counter ( Ctx Int -- | Yield Int )   # Yields integers, takes a context
  tuck yield        # yield current count, receive resume value
  drop swap 1 i.+ counter
;
```

*Guaranteed tail call optimization.* Recursive functions run in constant stack space via LLVM's `musttail`. Write elegant recursive algorithms without stack overflow concerns.

*CSP-style concurrency.* Lightweight strands (green threads) communicate through channels. No shared memory, no locks - just message passing.

*No implicit numeric conversions.* Operations like `i.+` and `f.+` make types explicit. No silent coercion, no precision loss, no "wat" moments - when you need to mix types, you convert explicitly with `int->float` or `float->int`.

## Installation

*Prerequisites* — **clang** is required to compile Seq programs (used to compile LLVM IR to native executables):
- macOS: `xcode-select --install`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `apt install clang libedit-dev`
- Fedora: `dnf install clang`

*Install from crates.io:*

```bash
cargo install seq-compiler
cargo install seq-repl
cargo install seq-lsp
```

This installs the following binaries:

| Crate | Binary | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `seq-compiler` | `seqc` | Compiler (`.seq` to native executable) |
| `seq-repl` | `seqr` | Interactive REPL |
| `seq-lsp` | `seq-lsp` | Language server for editor integration |

*Build from source:*

```bash
cargo build --release
```

*Virtual Environments* — Create isolated environments to manage multiple Seq versions or pin a specific version for a project:

```bash
seqc venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

This copies the `seqc`, `seqr`, and `seq-lsp` binaries into `myenv/bin/`, completely isolated from your system installation. Unlike Python's venv (which uses symlinks), Seq copies binaries so your project won't break if the system Seq is updated.

Activate/deactivate:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate   # Prepends myenv/bin to PATH, shows (myenv) in prompt
deactivate                  # Restores original PATH
```

Supports bash, zsh, fish (`activate.fish`), and csh/tcsh (`activate.csh`).

---

## Quick Start

Compile and run a program:
```bash
seqc build examples/basics/hello-world.seq
./hello-world
```

Script mode (run directly):
```bash
seqc examples/basics/hello-world.seq          # Compile and run in one step
```

Scripts can use shebangs for direct execution:
```seq
#!/usr/bin/env seqc
: main ( -- Int ) "Hello from script!" io.write-line 0 ;
```

```bash
chmod +x myscript.seq
./myscript.seq arg1 arg2    # Shebang invokes seqc automatically
```

Script mode compiles with `-O0` for fast startup and caches binaries in `~/.cache/seq/` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/seq/`). Cache keys include the source and all includes, so scripts recompile automatically when dependencies change.

Check version:
```bash
seqc --version
```

Run tests:
```bash
cargo test --all
```

## Learn Seq

New to concatenative programming? Start with the [Glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md) - it explains concepts like stack effects, quotations, row polymorphism, and CSP in plain terms.

Learn by doing: Work through [seqlings](https://github.com/navicore/seqlings) - hands-on exercises that teach the language step by step, covering stack operations, arithmetic, control flow, quotations, and more. Each exercise includes hints and automatic verification.

---

## Interactive REPL

The `seqr` REPL provides an interactive environment for exploring Seq:

```bash
seqr
```

Stack persists across lines:
```
seqr> 1 2
stack: 1 2
seqr> i.+
stack: 3
seqr> 5
stack: 3 5
seqr> : square ( Int -- Int ) dup i.* ;
Defined.
seqr> square
stack: 3 25
```

Commands: `:clear` (reset), `:edit` (open in $EDITOR), `:pop` (undo), `:quit` (exit), `:show` (show file), `:stack` (show stack)

Editing: Vi-mode (Esc for normal, i for insert), Shift+Enter (newline), Tab (completions), F1/F2/F3 (toggle IR views)

## Language Features

*Stack Operations & Arithmetic:*
```seq
dup drop swap over rot nip tuck pick 2dup 3drop   # Stack manipulation
i.+ i.- i.* i./ i.%                               # Integer arithmetic
f.+ f.- f.* f./                                   # Float arithmetic
i.= i.< i.> i.<= i.>= i.<>                        # Comparisons
band bor bxor bnot shl shr popcount               # Bitwise operations
```

Numeric literals support decimal, hex (`0xFF`), and binary (`0b1010`).

*Algebraic Data Types* — Define sum types with `union` and pattern match with `match`:

```seq
union Option { None, Some { value: Int } }

: unwrap-or ( Option Int -- Int )
  swap match
    None ->
    Some { >value } -> nip
  end
;
```

*Quotations & Higher-Order Programming* — Quotations are first-class anonymous functions:

```seq
[ dup i.* ] 5 swap call    # Square 5 → 25
my-list [ 2 i.* ] list.map # Double each element
```

*Concurrency* — Strands (green threads) communicate through channels:

```seq
chan.make
dup [ 42 swap chan.send drop ] strand.spawn drop
chan.receive drop    # Receives 42
```

Weaves provide generator-style coroutines with bidirectional communication:

```seq
[ my-generator ] strand.weave
initial-value strand.resume   # Yields values back and forth
```

*Standard Library* — Import modules with `include std:module`:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `std:json` | JSON parsing and serialization |
| `std:yaml` | YAML parsing and serialization |
| `std:http` | HTTP request/response utilities |
| `std:math` | Mathematical functions |
| `std:stack-utils` | Stack manipulation utilities |

## Configuration

Environment Variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SEQ_STACK_SIZE` | 131072 (128KB) | Coroutine stack size in bytes |
| `SEQ_YIELD_INTERVAL` | 0 (disabled) | Yield to scheduler every N tail calls |
| `SEQ_WATCHDOG_SECS` | 0 (disabled) | Detect strands running longer than N seconds |
| `SEQ_REPORT` | unset (disabled) | At-exit KPI report: `1` (human to stderr), `json` (JSON to stderr), `json:/path` (JSON to file) |

```bash
SEQ_STACK_SIZE=262144 ./my-program       # 256KB stacks
SEQ_YIELD_INTERVAL=10000 ./my-program    # Yield every 10K tail calls

SEQ_REPORT=1 ./my-program                # Print KPI report on exit
```

Compile with `--instrument` for per-word call counts in the report:
```bash
seqc build --instrument my-program.seq
SEQ_REPORT=1 ./my-program                # Report includes word call counts
```
